# Installation

## First Time Setup

During the alpha stage, installation is just downloading the
[latest archive from the releases area](https://github.com/cretz/doogie/releases), extracting it, and running the
`doogie` executable within.

### Windows Permissions

The alpha executables are not code-signed with a certificate and are not recognized as safe software from Microsoft.
Therefore, executing `doogie.exe` on Windows will likely warn the user about a dangerous executable. Bypass this warning
if you trust this software (only required the first time).

## Upgrade

During the alpha stage, upgrade is just doing the same thing as first time setup.

Doogie does not yet have an auto-updater.
